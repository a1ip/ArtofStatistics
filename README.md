# The Art of Statistics: Code, Data, Errata and Additions

UK hardback: ![](art-cover.png) UK paperback: ![](paperback-cover.png)
US hardback: ![](US-cover.png)

Here is the book’s [UK Amazon
page](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Statistics-Learning-Pelican-Books/dp/0241398630)
and [US Amazon
page](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=spiegelhalter&qid=1564306871&s=gateway&sr=8-2)

The UK and US hardback versions are identical in content. Errata and
additions are listed below for all versions.

This file is produced by R Markdown, and there is also a
[web-page](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/) produced by
Github.

## Code repository

The [repository](https://github.com/dspiegel29/ArtofStatistics) contains
data and R code for the Figures and Tables in Art of Statistics. They
should all work in RStudio.

  - It is not yet complete, and will change and improve.

  - The graphics were originally mainly produced in basic R, but (with
    much appreciated assistance) these have been mainly revised into
    ggplot2 - sometimes both versions are provided for comparison.
    However I do not pretend to have any particular skill in using R or
    ggplot, and no doubt many improvements could be made.

  - Many packages are used and will need to be installed, for example
    using install.packages(“ggplot2”)

  - While the individual files can be downloaded, it is probably easiest
    to download a zipped repository using the green download button.

    bar-chart, it may be better to use dots for the data-points when the
    axis does not start at zero.’
  - page 49 Footnote. ‘31,337’ was probably a deliberate choice by an
    ageing geek, as it was an old expression for [‘eleet /
    elite’](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=31337)
  - page 59 Legend for Figure 2.6, replace ‘Alberto Cairo’s’ by ‘the’

    0.32, 0.64, 0.04, as described in the footnote. Figures 9.1e and
    9.1f are incorrect, the peak should be centred at 0.2, and 9.1e has
    an apparent layer of probability smeared over the whole range. The
    correct version of Figure 9.1 is shown below, and can be found on
    the Github repository ![](09-1-left-hander-binomial.png)

    (having spelt it correctly as ’Ioannidis’at the start of the
    previous paragraph )
  - page 375 Headings of Table 13.1. ‘O’ in ‘Others’ is printed as a
    zero rather than an ‘O’
  - page 409 Footnote 4, insert at start ’ Data are from the ‘Datasaurus
    Dozen’, <https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats>,
    which includes ’
  - page 416 Note 7 ends with ‘p.000’, which should be ‘p.92’

    ball at random from the bag, record its value, and then replace it,
    restoring the number of balls in the bag to 50. We repeat this
    process of picking, recording and replacing a total of 50 times,
    producing a distribution of data-points such as “Boot 1”.’
